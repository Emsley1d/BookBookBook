# React News

A practice exercise created with React using [Robin Wieruch's](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) "Road to React" as a guide.

The app pulls links to tech articles from a 3rd Party [API](https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=) and allows the user to; Search by key words to return relevant articles and to remove articles from the list via a 'remove' button.

No styling was applied as I was focusing purely on the functionality.
